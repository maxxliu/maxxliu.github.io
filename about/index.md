I am currently a consultant at McKinsey in the
[Silicon Valley](https://www.mckinsey.com/west-coast)
office. I am
passionate about technology and startups (primarily consumer tech products and
media) and believe that being an entrepreneur is not a title but rather a
mindset when approaching processes and challenges. Specifically, I am interested
in the applications of machine learning, mobile computing, and computer vision
in understanding the world around us. I envision a future where users will be
able to seamlessly interact with both the real and the virtual, not limited by
the screen size of their devices. Some areas that I think could make this
possible are AR/VR/MR, edge computing, spatial computing, mobile sensing, and
smart cities, among many others. Right now I am particularly fascinated by
developments in AR and developments in how users consume content.

Previously I studied computer science at UChicago and researched mobile
computing topics at
[Sand Lab](http://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/index.html)
under Heather Zheng and Yanzi Zhu. I also played
varsity tennis for UChicago and was a
[Dougan Scholar](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/programs/dougan-scholars-program)
at Booth. Current
students - feel free to reach out if you have any questions!

**A quote that I find calming to recite throughout the day:**
*“The people I deal with today
will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are
like this because they can’t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of
good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a
nature related to my own - not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind,
and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me.”* - Marcus
Aurelius

## Other interests

**TV:**
I have a bad habit of binging the same TV shows over and over again back to back
but sometimes the show is just too good. Hands down my favorite TV show is Psych
(starring the amazing James Roday and Dule Hill), I mean who wouldn't want to
start a psychic detective agency with their best friend in Santa Barbara?

**Music:**
This is essential to my daily routine.

**Hobbies:**
Outside of my professional interests, I love playing sports and exploring
cities and new areas. I am also looking to get into pretty much any extreme
sport or slightly dangerous outdoor activity.

**Food:**
I probably spend too much time talking about coconut water.
