I am currently a fourth year at UChicago studying computer science and an
undergraduate research assistant at
[Sand Lab](http://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/index.html).
I am passionate about technology and startups and believe that being an
entrepreneur is not a title but rather a mindset when approaching processes
and challenges. Specifically, I am interested in the applications of machine
learning,
mobile computing, and computer vision in understanding the world around us. I
envision a
future where users will be able to seamlessly interact with both the real and
the virtual,
not limited by the screen size of their devices. Some areas that I think could
make this
possible are AR/VR/MR, edge computing, spatial computing, mobile sensing, and
smart
cities, among many others. Right now I am particularly fascinated by
developments in AR.

## Books

Here are some of the books that I have read/ am currently reading;
**my favorites

entrepreneurship
but I am trying to expand the breadth of books that I read. If you have book

## TV, Movies, Music

I have a bad habit of binging the same TV shows over and over again back to back
but sometimes the show is just too good. Hands down my favorite TV show is Psych
(starring the amazing James Roday and Dule Hill), I mean who wouldn't want to
start a psychic detective agency with their best friend in Santa Barbara?
Beyond Psych, here are some more of my top TV shows and movies (in no particular
order):

- Psych
- The Office
- Parks and Recreation
- Brooklyn 99
- Friends
- How I Met Your Mother
- New Girl
- Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse

Music is essential to my daily routine. Here are the artists I am listening to
right now (in no particular order):

- Post Malone
- Swae Lee
- Amine
- Dua Lipa
- Gallant
- Luke Christopher
- The Weeknd
- Japanese Wallpaper
- Violents, Monica Martin

## Hobbies

I enjoy playing sports as well as a variety of outdoor activites. The amount of
time that I spend exercising has decreased significantly since starting college
but I still enjoy trying new things and learning new skills!

**Tennis** - This is more of a love hate relationship but I am always down to
play doubles!

**Basketball** - I love the team aspect of the game especially because I grew up
playing an individual sport. Additionally, it is super interesting to explore
what insights basketball analytics can provide (especially applications of
computer vision in basketball videos).

**Longboarding** - Some of my best memories from college include riding down the
North Parking Garage at midnight when there were no more cars around. Longboard
dancing is also a beautiful sport that I am trying to get more into. If you are
interested, Hans Wouters has a beautiful Youtube channel on longboard dancing.
