                          Recently I have found myself spending a lot of time playing around with IKEA Place. The premise of the app is extremely simple: visualize how various IKEA products would look in your home. No more manual measurements and mental visualizations; this app speeds up the process of purchasing furniture by ensuring that new pieces fit in your home and look good. But IKEA Place is not just another mobile AR app, IKEA Place is a product that adds value to the customer experience by solving a key pain point in the purchasing process and it just so happens that the best way to deliver that value is through mobile AR. The reason I find IKEA Place to be so enjoyable and such a compelling mobile AR product is because:

                                The app communicates to me in a familiar way that feels very personal
                            </li>
                            <li style="font-weight:500">
                                The UI is extremely intuitive, and the AR graphics are some of the best that I have seen on mobile
                            </li>
                            <li style="font-weight:500">
                                The app is functional
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                      <p>
                  </div>

                  <div id="section1" class="section scrollspy">
                      <h5 class="left-align">Communication</h5>
                      <div class="divider"></div>
                      <p style="text-align:left; font-weight:400">
                          The app communicates to me in a familiar way that feels very personal and demonstrates to me that the development and management team had a clear customer segment that they were targeting. Traditionally, a large segment of IKEA’s customers consisted of young working professionals. These customers bought furniture outside of working hours (IKEA closes at 9PM) and looked for good looking, affordable, easy to assemble furniture. IKEA Place continues to focus attention on this segment, and it shows through their design choices.
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align:left; font-weight:400">
                          After installing the app, the user is immediately presented a messenger-like screen where the app walks through its different capabilities and prompts the user to interact with it and send responses back. It then explains why it needs access to the camera before asking for permission, a simple gesture that really stands out. This introduction sequence sets up the foundation for how the app communicates with the user.
                      </p>
                      <div class="center-align">

                      </div>
                      <p style="text-align:left; font-weight:400">
                          I spend a lot of time each day on iMessage and Messenger, so it was immediately familiar when the app communicated to me in a similar way. While using the app, information is communicated through chat bubbles that appear at the top giving prompts to try certain features or just simply to welcome me back after opening the app. The overall experience feels very personal, like having an assistant sending me messages through the app, but not robotic. The app’s messages feel very casual and conversational, even adding in emojis.

                          Although unrelated to the product, I also find their promotional videos to be incredibly interesting. One of their videos shows young adults struggling with furniture and the other is a fun video where AR gamers try out the app. The feel of the videos is very modern and is clearly targeted towards young adults.
                          You can find the videos

                          Through a clear understanding of their initial target customer segment, IKEA Place makes design choices that lead to an enjoyable and memorable user experience.

                      <p style="text-align:left; font-weight:400">
                          To begin, the UI is extremely intuitive. On the home screen there are three buttons: search for similar products, find products to place in your room, view favorited products. The presentation is simple and the icons on the buttons are informative of their purpose. While using the app and trying out the different features I never felt lost or confused. The steps required to perform an action were clear to me and allowed me to solely focus on picking out different products and placing them in the space around me.
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align:left; font-weight:400">
                          Furthermore, the quality of the AR graphics in IKEA Place look really good. Objects that you place in your room really feel like they are sitting on the ground and have realistic shadows. Additionally, the objects scale correctly as you move around it and remain in place when out of frame.  These are small things that we may take for granted in mobile AR but when done well it really stands out. IKEA Place is built on ARKit for iOS and ARCore for Android, I am excited to see new applications for mobile AR emerge as both these platforms continue to improve.

                          Mobile AR is often underwhelming for users that are looking for truly immersive experiences, but nonetheless mobile AR still has a place in the AR field, both as a stepping stone and as a type of use case. IKEA Place is a perfect example of how by combining simple design with great graphics, mobile AR can also deliver a realistic and immersive experience.

                          At the end of the day, IKEA Place creates a functional solution to the problems that consumers face when purchasing furniture. The purpose of AR is clear and enhances the customer experience. The interface and design work together to deliver value to the user and do not take away from the functionality of the app.

                      <p style="text-align:left; font-weight:400">
                          Mobile AR is often a gimmick, not adding any real value and actually taking away from the functionality of the product. Even in well designed products it can be tough to integrate AR in a meaningful way. For example, Pokémon Go integrates AR into the Pokémon catching experience but most players opt out of using AR mode and most of the game takes place outside of an AR experience. To be fair, I think AR does add value to Pokémon Go and they have been improving their AR experience with AR Plus but it is still interesting to think about how to best integrate AR into your product and if AR adds value to the user experience.

                          IKEA Place set themselves up for success by choosing a problem that is best solved through AR and then delivers an amazing mobile AR experience that provides the essential functionality to actually solve that problem.

                          IKEA Place is a very good mobile AR product that I thoroughly enjoyed using; however, it is not without its flaws. The app could have integrated mobile purchasing for furniture that a customer has tried out and favorited to complete the full pipeline from downloading the app to making a purchase. Currently a customer would have to try out different products in the app and then click on the name of each product individually (while in AR mode) to be redirected to the IKEA website before making the purchase. It would be cool to see a more noticeable and friendlier interface for making mobile purchases along with Apple/Google Pay integration. Overall, IKEA Place is a great product and I look forward seeing what the IKEA digital transformation team comes up with next!
