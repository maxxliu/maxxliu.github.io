                          For those of you that don’t know, the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference is a conference held every year in Boston where industry leaders in basketball, football, baseball, etc., researchers, startups, and analytics enthusiasts gather to discuss and learn about all things related to sports analytics. This year it was held at the Hynes Convention Center from March 1-2 and I was fortunate enough to attend both the conference and the hackathon that took place the day before. The conference was especially exciting for me because in the fall I worked on action recognition with the purpose of applying it to basketball footage and this would be an amazing place to learn more about the cutting edge in computer vision application for sports.
                      </p>

                      <p style="text-align:left; font-weight:400">
                          The theme for this year’s hackathon was designing a unique digital fan experience; we were given hawk eye data and match data from the 2018 BNP Paribas Open, specifically from the women’s matches, to complete the challenge. Hawk eye data included the exact locations of the tennis ball during the serve as well as information about point duration and how the point was won. We actually made it to the finals of the competition which was super exciting, and were given the opportunity to present our idea during the second day of the conference. I’m not going to go super in depth into the idea and the models, but you can find our final presentation

                          During the conference I had the opportunity to hear a ton of amazing people talk about sports as well as meet a bunch of people from startups doing really cool work with computer vision and AR/VR (pose estimation, action recognition, VR training, etc.). Some of my personal favorites were:
                      </p>
                      <ol style="list-style-type:disc;">
                        <li>Bob Myers, Zach Lowe, Mike Zarren, and Paul Pierce talking about “unicorns” in basketball. It was a super fun discussion and one of my biggest takeaways was that Shaq would still be an unreal player in the NBA today.</li>
                        <li>Meek Mill and Michael Rubin discussing social justice reform. A truly inspiring talk and extremely eye opening to hear about the side of America that so many of us have the privilege of not seeing on a day to day basis.</li>
                        <li>Adam Silver answering a bunch of questions pertaining to the current state of the NBA and its players. The most surprising thing that Adam Silver discussed was the disconnect between how fans perceive the professional basketball lifestyle and the reality of players and their mental health.</li>
                        <li>Katie Nolan, Larry Fitzgerald, Adam Hansmann, and Jeanie Buss discussing the relationship between athletes and the media and how that has evolved over the years. It was very interesting to hear so many perspectives on this topic from players and owners to people who create media content.</li>
                        <li>Malcolm Gladwell and David Epstein discussing the modern athlete and what it takes to become a world class athlete. This was the most relevant talk for me in terms of tennis and improving myself as a tennis player; most of the talk revolved around the theme of why it is important to acquire a diverse set of skills and try new things rather than hyper specialize in one area from an extremely young age.</li>
                      </ol>

                          Overall, I had an amazing time at the conference and I look forward to having an opportunity to attend again!
