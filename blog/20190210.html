                          Warby Parkerâ€™s new virtual try-on feature delivers an AR experience real enough that current and future customers might actually skip the store and the home try-on before making a purchase. Trying on glasses virtually/online is not something new; many companies and websites have been doing this for quite a while, either by uploading a picture of your face or through the webcam. The overall experience of these methods was poor and it never felt like you were getting a realistic view of how the glasses looked. Warby Parker has always been known to be extremely thoughtful about the customer and they definitely worked hard to create an experience that was as valuable to the customer as possible.

                          For the rest of this post we will deviate slightly away from Warby Parker to talk about the impact of AR in the fashion/clothing industry; specifically, how AR will change online shopping and the possibility of collaborative shopping. Given the collaborative nature of AR, we end with a discussion on how AR can change the way we present ourselves to others.

                      <p style="text-align:left; font-weight:400">
                          The two biggest issues that I face when online shopping are: 1) not knowing if the item will look good and 2) not knowing which size to choose.
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align:left; font-weight:400">
                          Warby Parker uses home try-on as a solution to this problem, customers can choose up to 5 frames to try on at home for free and then send back. However, I think this program still creates some friction between looking at the glasses online and actually purchasing a pair. It takes around 5 days for the home try-on frames to arrive and another 5 days for the purchased frames to arrive, I imagine this whole process will take around 2 weeks as well as a trip to the mailbox to ship the frames back (which can be a hassle). Virtual try-on improves the confidence consumers have when purchasing frames without trying the real frames. I believe an ideal shopping experience should involve only one shipment where every item looks/fits as great as the customer expected. AR will make this a reality.
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align:left; font-weight:400">
                          AR, computer vision, and sensors will improve to a point in the near future where they can accurately create 3D models of the human body and overlay virtual clothing over the model that moves and reacts just like real fabric. This will transform the online shopping experience; every item can be rendered perfectly over any body giving the consumer confidence that whichever item they choose will look/fit great. Even items in your own wardrobe can be virtually tried on before deciding on an outfit. A ton of companies are already starting to develop technology to make this possible, Uniqlo, Gap, Amazon, etc.
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align:left; font-weight:400">
                          Ultimately, this can lead to collaborative AR shopping where friends can view the item and give you feedback while you try it on. Physical fitting rooms have many limitations that collaborative virtual fitting rooms can solve: 1) it is hard to get feedback from friends on clothing, 2) during busy hours there is a line for the fitting room, 3) you have to bring multiple sizes of the same item with you or go back out to find the correct size. I think there is a ton of potential for collaborative AR fitting rooms, friends across the world can go shopping with each other, stylists can give advice to clients remotely, etc. It is extremely exciting to think about how AR can connect people in meaningful ways.

                          I think that AR has the ability to fundamentally change how we express ourselves. Given an environment where many users are using head mounted AR, there is no limitation to how we dress ourselves virtually and present ourselves to others. Rather than constantly purchasing new clothes, which can be quite expensive, or being limited by the selection at shops, consumers can virtually dress themselves in whatever they want. Imagine walking down the street in a t-shirt and sweats but everyone else sees you walking in a full suit of armor. Imagine going into a business meeting in jeans but everyone else sees you in a suit. Anyone can dress however they want at almost no cost.
