      <title><![CDATA[MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference 2019]]></title>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[This post is coming a bit late, but I have finally finishedWinter quarter at UChicago and am excited to share some ofmy experiences from the MIT Sloan Sports AnalyticsConference!#SSAC19For those of you that don’t know, the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference is aconference held every year in Boston where industry leaders in basketball,football, baseball, etc., researchers, startups, and analytics enthusiastsgather to discuss and learn about all things related to sports analytics. Thisyear it was held at the Hynes Convention Center from March 1-2 and I wasfortunate enough to attend both the conference and the hackathon that tookplace the day before. The conference was especially exciting for me because inthe fall I worked on action recognition with the purpose of applying it tobasketball footage and this would be an amazing place to learn more about thecutting edge in computer vision application for sports.The theme for this year’s hackathon was designing a unique digital fanexperience; we were given hawk eye data and match data from the 2018 BNPParibas Open, specifically from the women’s matches, to complete the challenge.Hawk eye data included the exact locations of the tennis ball during the serveas well as information about point duration and how the point was won. Weactually made it to the finals of the competition which was super exciting, andwere given the opportunity to present our idea during the second day of theconference. I’m not going to go super in depth into the idea and the models,but you can find our final presentationhere, a rough demohere(my first time using sketch and it was an amazing learning experience),and the final presentationshere(we start about 50 minutes in).During the conference I had the opportunity to hear a ton of amazing peopletalk about sports as well as meet a bunch of people from startups doing reallycool work with computer vision and AR/VR (pose estimation, action recognition,VR training, etc.). Some of my personal favorites were:  Bob Myers, Zach Lowe, Mike Zarren, and Paul Pierce talking about “unicorns”in basketball. It was a super fun discussion and one of my biggest takeaways wasthat Shaq would still be an unreal player in the NBA today.  Meek Mill and Michael Rubin discussing social justice reform. A trulyinspiring talk and extremely eye opening to hear about the side of America thatso many of us have the privilege of not seeing on a day to day basis.  Adam Silver answering a bunch of questions pertaining to the current state ofthe NBA and its players. The most surprising thing that Adam Silver discussedwas the disconnect between how fans perceive the professional basketballlifestyle and the reality of players and their mental health.  Katie Nolan, Larry Fitzgerald, Adam Hansmann, and Jeanie Buss discussing therelationship between athletes and the media and how that has evolved over theyears. It was very interesting to hear so many perspectives on this topic fromplayers and owners to people who create media content.  Malcolm Gladwell and David Epstein discussing the modern athlete and what ittakes to become a world class athlete. This was the most relevant talk for me interms of tennis and improving myself as a tennis player; most of the talkrevolved around the theme of why it is important to acquire a diverse set ofskills and try new things rather than hyper specialize in one area from anextremely young age.Overall, I had an amazing time at the conference and I look forward to havingan opportunity to attend again!Please do not hesitate to reach out and provide commentary or feedback on thispost!]]></content>

      <title><![CDATA[Warby Parker AR]]></title>
      <url>/ar/vr/2019/02/10/warby-parker-ar/</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Warby Parker introduces virtual try-on using ARKit. The results are realisticand I am excited by the impact AR will have on the fashion/clothing industry.AR may even have the potential to change the way people express their style inthe future!OverviewWarby Parker’s new virtual try-on feature delivers an AR experience real enoughthat current and future customers might actually skip the store and the hometry-on before making a purchase. Trying on glasses virtually/online is notsomething new; many companies and websites have been doing this for quite awhile, either by uploading a picture of your face or through the webcam. Theoverall experience of these methods was poor and it never felt like you weregetting a realistic view of how the glasses looked. Warby Parker has always beenknown to be extremely thoughtful about the customer and they definitely workedhard to create an experience that was as valuable to the customer as possible.For the rest of this post we will deviate slightly away from Warby Parker totalk about the impact of AR in the fashion/clothing industry; specifically,how AR will change online shopping and the possibility of collaborativeshopping. Given the collaborative nature of AR, we end with a discussion onhow AR can change the way we present ourselves to others.AR and Online ShoppingThe two biggest issues that I face when online shopping are: 1) not knowing ifthe item will look good and 2) not knowing which size to choose.Warby Parker uses home try-on as a solution to this problem, customers canchoose up to 5 frames to try on at home for free and then send back. However,I think this program still creates some friction between looking at the glassesonline and actually purchasing a pair. It takes around 5 days for the hometry-on frames to arrive and another 5 days for the purchased frames to arrive,I imagine this whole process will take around 2 weeks as well as a trip to themailbox to ship the frames back (which can be a hassle). Virtual try-on improvesthe confidence consumers have when purchasing frames without trying the realframes. I believe an ideal shopping experience should involve only one shipmentwhere every item looks/fits as great as the customer expected. AR will makethis a reality.AR, computer vision, and sensors will improve to a point in the near futurewhere they can accurately create 3D models of the human body and overlay virtualclothing over the model that moves and reacts just like real fabric. This willtransform the online shopping experience; every item can be rendered perfectlyover any body giving the consumer confidence that whichever item they choosewill look/fit great. Even items in your own wardrobe can be virtually tried onbefore deciding on an outfit. A ton of companies are already starting to developtechnology to make this possible, Uniqlo, Gap, Amazon, etc.Ultimately, this can lead to collaborative AR shopping where friends can viewthe item and give you feedback while you try it on. Physical fitting rooms havemany limitations that collaborative virtual fitting rooms can solve: 1) it ishard to get feedback from friends on clothing, 2) during busy hours there is aline for the fitting room, 3) you have to bring multiple sizes of the same itemwith you or go back out to find the correct size. I think there is a ton ofpotential for collaborative AR fitting rooms, friends across the world can goshopping with each other, stylists can give advice to clients remotely, etc. Itis extremely exciting to think about how AR can connect people in meaningfulways.Final ThoughtsI think that AR has the ability to fundamentally change how we expressourselves. Given an environment where many users are using head mounted AR,there is no limitation to how we dress ourselves virtually and present ourselvesto others. Rather than constantly purchasing new clothes, which can be quiteexpensive, or being limited by the selection at shops, consumers can virtuallydress themselves in whatever they want. Imagine walking down the street in at-shirt and sweats but everyone else sees you walking in a full suit of armor.Imagine going into a business meeting in jeans but everyone else sees you in asuit. Anyone can dress however they want at almost no cost.Please do not hesitate to reach out and provide commentary or feedback on thispost!]]></content>

      <title><![CDATA[IKEA Place]]></title>
      <url>/ar/vr/2019/01/31/ikea-place/</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[IKEA Place is one of the few mobile AR apps that uses AR to address a realcustomer pain point and is actually really fun to use.IntroductionRecently I have found myself spending a lot of time playing around with IKEAPlace. The premise of the app is extremely simple: visualize how various IKEAproducts would look in your home. No more manual measurements and mentalvisualizations; this app speeds up the process of purchasing furniture byensuring that new pieces fit in your home and look good. But IKEA Place is notjust another mobile AR app, IKEA Place is a product that adds value to thecustomer experience by solving a key pain point in the purchasing process and itjust so happens that the best way to deliver that value is through mobile AR.The reason I find IKEA Place to be so enjoyable and such a compelling mobileAR product is because:  The app communicates to me in a familiar way that feels very personal  The UI is extremely intuitive, and the AR graphics are some of the bestthat I have seen on mobile  The app is functionalCommunicationThe app communicates to me in a familiar way that feels very personal anddemonstrates to me that the development and management team had a clear customersegment that they were targeting. Traditionally, a large segment of IKEA’scustomers consisted of young working professionals. These customers boughtfurniture outside of working hours (IKEA closes at 9PM) and looked for goodlooking, affordable, easy to assemble furniture. IKEA Place continues to focusattention on this segment, and it shows through their design choices.After installing the app, the user is immediately presented a messenger-likescreen where the app walks through its different capabilities and prompts theuser to interact with it and send responses back. It then explains why it needsaccess to the camera before asking for permission, a simple gesture that reallystands out. This introduction sequence sets up the foundation for how the appcommunicates with the user.I spend a lot of time each day on iMessage and Messenger, so it was immediatelyfamiliar when the app communicated to me in a similar way. While using the app,information is communicated through chat bubbles that appear at the top givingprompts to try certain features or just simply to welcome me back after openingthe app. The overall experience feels very personal, like having an assistantsending me messages through the app, but not robotic. The app’s messages feelvery casual and conversational, even adding in emojis.Although unrelated to the product, I also find their promotional videos to beincredibly interesting. One of their videos shows young adults struggling withfurniture and the other is a fun video where AR gamers try out the app. The feelof the videos is very modern and is clearly targeted towards young adults.You can find the videoshere andhere.Through a clear understanding of their initial target customer segment, IKEAPlace makes design choices that lead to an enjoyable and memorable userexperience.UI and GraphicsTo begin, the UI is extremely intuitive. On the home screen there are threebuttons: search for similar products, find products to place in your room, viewfavorited products. The presentation is simple and the icons on the buttons areinformative of their purpose. While using the app and trying out the differentfeatures I never felt lost or confused. The steps required to perform an actionwere clear to me and allowed me to solely focus on picking out differentproducts and placing them in the space around me.Furthermore, the quality of the AR graphics in IKEA Place look really good.Objects that you place in your room really feel like they are sitting on theground and have realistic shadows. Additionally, the objects scale correctly asyou move around it and remain in place when out of frame. These are small thingsthat we may take for granted in mobile AR but when done well it really standsout. IKEA Place is built on ARKit for iOS and ARCore for Android, I am excitedto see new applications for mobile AR emerge as both these platforms continue toimprove.Mobile AR is often underwhelming for users that are looking for truly immersiveexperiences, but nonetheless mobile AR still has a place in the AR field, bothas a stepping stone and as a type of use case. IKEA Place is a perfect exampleof how by combining simple design with great graphics, mobile AR can alsodeliver a realistic and immersive experience.FunctionalAt the end of the day, IKEA Place creates a functional solution to the problemsthat consumers face when purchasing furniture. The purpose of AR is clear andenhances the customer experience. The interface and design work together todeliver value to the user and do not take away from the functionality of theapp.Mobile AR is often a gimmick, not adding any real value and actually taking awayfrom the functionality of the product. Even in well designed products it can betough to integrate AR in a meaningful way. For example, Pokémon Go integrates ARinto the Pokémon catching experience but most players opt out of using AR modeand most of the game takes place outside of an AR experience. To be fair, Ithink AR does add value to Pokémon Go and they have been improving their ARexperience with AR Plus but it is still interesting to think about how to bestintegrate AR into your product and if AR adds value to the user experience.IKEA Place set themselves up for success by choosing a problem that is bestsolved through AR and then delivers an amazing mobile AR experience thatprovides the essential functionality to actually solve that problem.Final ThoughtsIKEA Place is a very good mobile AR product that I thoroughly enjoyed using;however, it is not without its flaws. The app could have integrated mobilepurchasing for furniture that a customer has tried out and favorited to completethe full pipeline from downloading the app to making a purchase. Currently acustomer would have to try out different products in the app and then click onthe name of each product individually (while in AR mode) to be redirected to theIKEA website before making the purchase. It would be cool to see a morenoticeable and friendlier interface for making mobile purchases along withApple/Google Pay integration. Overall, IKEA Place is a great product and I lookforward seeing what the IKEA digital transformation team comes up with next!Please do not hesitate to reach out and provide commentary or feedback on thispost!]]></content>
