      <content type="text"><![CDATA[I have been extremely fortunate to play tennis for the majority of my life andto have been recruited by UChicago to play college tennis; now I want to sharesome of the major lessons that I have learned from four years of college tennis.Who this post is for and how to use itThis post is primarily directed towards Division 3 athletes; specifically, those who have played college tennis or are currently playing college tennis. However, I still think that there are useful pieces of information that can be applied no matter what sport or level of sport you have been/are involved in.The lessons and ideas presented are based on my personal experience competing on the tennis team and interacting with my coaches and teammates. Not all of these ideas will hold true across teams and sports, you may even have experiences that contradict these ideas, that is fine, take the pieces that are useful to you and ignore the rest.The remainder of this post is split into three sections:  Lessons I have learned from college tennis  How these same lessons apply off the court  Ideas on how to improve the program (this is for both players and coaches)Finally, this post is a thank you to all my coaches and teammates that have gone on this adventure with me and whom I proudly call my family.Lessons I have learned from college tennis(1) Be clear with your goals and develop a road map for how to reach them.This is an area that I have personally struggled with throughout my time playing college tennis. In the juniors, I was used to the individual attention that I received when working with my coaches and they were very active in identifying exactly what I needed to improve and how to get there. Furthermore, I constantly had opportunities to evaluate my performance and determine if I was moving in the correct direction because there was always a next tournament to compete in. These luxuries can no longer be taken for granted once you join a college team. The coach now needs to simultaneously manage over twelve players, decide who plays in the lineup, and then allocate their time accordingly. All of a sudden, you are now responsible for setting your goals and creating a plan to reach them and you will not always have an opportunity to compete in real matches and evaluate your performance. Do not count on the coach to tell you “Do A, B, C, and you will play number X on the team”.Now that we have identified a pain point, how exactly do you go about setting goals and developing a road map? I suggest working very closely with your coach when going through this process; make it extremely clear to them what your goals are and work together to create a road map for how to achieve it. This can be as simple as scheduling an hour or two block outside of practice and communicating very precisely with them to develop a game plan. Your coach ultimately decides the lineup and this will give you confidence that all of your hard work will not be for nothing; furthermore, this shows that you care.When setting goals, choose concrete and measurable goals. Instead of “I want to play in the lineup” or “I want to move up in the lineup”, say “I want to play number X in the lineup” or “I want to be ranked X in the country”. Tangible goals are easier to create plans for and force you to think realistically about what you can accomplish in a certain time frame. Once you reach the goal, you can confidently cross it out and move on to the next goal.Once you have a goal, you will need a road map for how to get there. This is the hardest part because it requires both you and your coach to coordinate and commit to the road map. I have seen players think that as long as they come to practice and work hard everyday they will eventually play in the lineup and I have heard coaches say the same thing; “Come to practice and work hard” is not a plan. Challenge yourself and your coach to think harder about what a concrete and measurable road map looks like. What are key areas that you need to improve? What drills or exercises can you do everyday to improve those areas? Who do you need to play more challenge matches against? Push your coach to make statements that you can hold them against, “Beat A, B, C in challenge matches and you will play X in the lineup”. These statements might seem intimidating to make but in the long run it will push everyone on the team to become better.Finally, once you have a goal and a road map that both you and your coach are on board with, communicate this to your teammates. Your teammates are not your opponents and are not a roadblock, they are there to support you and likely have goals of their own. Work together and support your teammates, push each other to create the best team possible. At the end of the day this is still a team sport.(2) Stick with things a little longer than you normally would.Improving as a player is difficult and frustrating, there will always be areas of your game that you feel are lacking and there will be days where you practice and feel as if you made no progress. It is even more frustrating when your coach is telling you to make certain changes that you are not comfortable with and it ends up making you play worse that day. This is a mindset that I often get trapped in and I have seen many other players and coaches get trapped in. We sacrifice potential long term gains in favor of short term results. Rather than keeping an open mind and honestly trying to make certain changes, we halfheartedly try it out for a couple shots, do not see immediate results, and revert back to whatever was “good enough” before. The same goes for coaches, they do not have time to thoroughly evaluate your game and often times the adjustments they ask you to make are based off of a couple of shots or one game.If you believe in what you are doing, whether that be a strategy or a slight adjustment to one of your strokes, stick with it just a little longer than you normally would. You might play a couple of bad points or hit a couple of bad shots, your coach might suggest you make a different adjustment, but if you feel like you are on the right track then stick with whatever you were doing before. This does not mean to actively ignore your coach, your coach is on your side and trying to help you improve, but in the end it is your game and if you continue to ask yourself the right questions and believe in what you are doing, feel free to stick with your own ideas for a little longer. If it continues to not work out, listen to your coach and make those adjustments.If your coach suggests an adjustment and initially you play some bad points, stick with it just a little longer than you normally would. Those first points and shots do not indicate poor coaching or an invalid adjustment. Take the time to think about whether those adjustments are valid and put some faith in your coach and believe that they might be able to see some things in your game that you cannot see. Even if those adjustments are uncomfortable in the beginning, you may be missing out on long term improvements by discounting your coach too quickly. Honestly try to make the adjustments and stick with it a little longer, if in the end it does not work out, do not be afraid to tell your coach and suggest a different solution.I want to clarify that the goal here is not to create an adversarial relationship with your coach and that the ideas you and your coach have may not necessarily be in conflict with one another. The coaches incentives are aligned with your own, to help you improve. The path to improvement is messy and it is necessary to filter out temporary solutions from real long term improvements; sticking with things a little longer is a good place to start.(3) Make smart sacrifices.A majority of college athletes, especially Division 3 athletes, are not playing their sport to become professional athletes. As such, it becomes important to balance athletics, academics, career (joining professional clubs, finding internships, etc.), a social life, etc. In most Division 3 schools, the administration and athletic program will stress academics over athletics. Regardless of what your priorities or goals are, it can be incredibly hard to juggle all of these things and be extremely successful in all of them (although there are amazing people who I have seen do this). I believe that it is more valuable to excel in a couple of these areas rather than be mediocre across all of them; therefore it is necessary to allocate your time accordingly and make smart sacrifices.Your professors or coaches may end up disappointed in the activities you choose to do but commit to your priorities and do not look back. Constantly reordering your priorities is a recipe for mediocrity. Once you have thought through your priorities, make the required sacrifices and accept the losses in order to become the best in your chosen areas. Do not feel pressured by others to stray from your goals and priorities; professors will always want you to spend more time on their class, coaches will always want you to spend more time training, some friends will always want you to spend more time socializing.In my personal experience, excelling in an area requires consistency and discipline. It is incredibly difficult to sacrifice athletics for academics and a social life for one season and then prioritize athletics when the national championship tournament rolls around later in the year. The building blocks for a successful national title run develop in the preseason and continue every single day until then; performing at your peak is not just a switch that you flip on when you need it. The same goes for academics, if you sacrifice your academics for other activities for a year or two, it is hard to re-prioritize academics and perform well; the building blocks for high level classes were developed in the introductory classes. This is not to say that priorities cannot change, but recognize that there may be challenges throughout this process and commit to overcoming them.How these same lessons apply off the courtAt the time of this writing I have yet to begin my full time job after graduation. These ideas are based off of my experiences so far and will likely change as I gain more experience and embark on more adventures.(1) Be clear with your goals and develop a road map for how to reach them.When you enter the workforce, you will again be placed into an environment where managers do not always have time to actively set goals and create road maps that are personalized for you. Take the time to communicate with your manager what your goals are and develop a concrete path to reach them. Afterwards, follow up consistently to ensure that you are still on track and get feedback on what you can improve. This will also prevent the pain of being blindsided during performance reviews.(2) Stick with things a little longer than you normally would.My take on this is closely linked to my passion for startups and entrepreneurship. Peter Thiel has mentioned that one of the most important questions is “What do people agree merely by convention, and what is the truth?” and will often ask interviewees, “Tell me something that’s true that very few people agree with you on”.When at work, is the obvious solution to a problem the best solution or is it just what someone above you told you to do? If you believe in something, stick with it and communicate to your manager why your solution is better. If you are working on a startup this is even more important, there will always be naysayers and you have to believe in what you are doing and continue to stick with it.On the other hand, you may be asked to perform a task or given advice that seems confusing. It is easy to discredit this or perform the task halfheartedly. For me, this is parallel to Mr. Miyagi telling Daniel to wax his car (“Wax on wax off” if you remember the original Karate Kid). A task that seems menial to Daniel but invaluable to Mr. Miyagi and ultimately teaches Daniel an important lesson. Your manager may have a lot more experience than you and is able to see things that are not clear to you yet, trust that they know what they are doing and commit to the activity.Again, these statements seem a little contradictory, when do you trust yourself and when do you trust others? This goes back to Peter Thiel’s question: what is convention and what is the truth? Take the time to really think through this and then commit to your decision.(3) Make smart sacrifices.Once you graduate, there are an infinite number of things to do and clearly you cannot do all of them. Is working 24/7 the best way to spend your time? What activities are you prioritizing because someone else told you to? What activities do you actually want to do? This is something that I am personally working to figure out right now. Moving to a new city, starting a new job, I want to remain in control of my activities and continue to focus on the things that matter most to me. All of this will come with sacrifices and I am prepared to make them in order to achieve the goals that I have set for myself.Ideas on how to improve the program(1) The beginning of the season is the time to experiment with lineups and doubles pairings.Take the time to work through lineup and doubles issues early in the season, coaches should not be afraid to try a lot of new things that may or may not work out because almost all of the most important matches and tournaments are later in the season.As a player, bringing up doubles issues halfway through or at the end of the season is usually a bad sign. The coach has very little time to react and may not be comfortable with making big changes so bringing this up so late may not be entirely helpful. Address these issues immediately.As a coach, waiting to make lineup changes until late in the season can also be harmful. Players do not have time to settle into their position which can negatively affect their performance. If a player is under performing, address the issue early on and either push them to be better or make a lineup change; do not allow these things to fester. Ultimately, I believe that lineups should generally become more stable as the season continues, not fall apart.(2) Be aggressively transparent with the lineup and feedback.Lineup decisions are always a little bit stressful for the coaches and players because a player is always moving down in the lineup, the player moving up has increased pressure to prove they deserve the spot, and the coach hopes that they made the right decision. It takes time to process these changes, but players are tough, players can handle lineup changes and move on.The key here is that it takes time to process the changes, even just one day. The worst thing to do is announce a decision the day of the match. Players are not given any time to process the change and enter the match with mixed emotions and may not be fully focused on the opponent in front of them. Why couldn’t this decision have been made twelve hours earlier? Give the players a little time to settle in and prepare mentally.Feedback is incredibly important in order to continuously improve both as a player and as a team. Players need to actively seek feedback and coaches should actively look to give it out, whether that be key weaknesses, strategy errors, or where a player currently stands in the lineup. This relates back to my first point of setting a goal and developing a road map. Feedback is critical to understanding if a player is on the right track to improving and moving up in the lineup.Coaches should not be afraid of giving out feedback and players should be open to receiving it. Feedback is not a personal attack on a player’s ability and players should be able to recognize that. Feedback is a genuine attempt by the coach to help improve the team and maintain a healthy dynamic with the team.(3) Train under pressure.I believe that in pressure situations, we do not rise to the occasion but rather fall back on our training. If you do not train under pressure, why would you expect to perform at your peak under pressure? In this case, training is defined as both practice and official matches. If you are up against a team that you are expected to roll through, why play at 40% and win 7-5, 7-5 just to prove that you can beat a player while not trying? Play at 100% and win 6-0, 6-0.Playing at 100% is not a switch, if you do not work on switching gears to 100% do not expect that in pressure situations you can kick up your level to 100%. Furthermore, winning 6-0, 6-0 is not an easy feat even against players you know you can beat; at minimum it requires you to make very few unforced errors and to have a basic understanding of their weaknesses.Challenge yourself to be better during every match and when you step into pressure situations you will be ready.Please do not hesitate to reach out and provide commentary or feedback on this post!Thank you to all my coaches and teammates: (Coaches) Jay Tee, Kris Powell, (’19) Charlie Pei, Jonathan Li, Will Szokol, (’18) Nicolas Chua, Peter Leung, David Liu, Luke Tsai, Bobby Bethke, Michael Selin, (’20) Jaird Meyer, Ninan Kumar, Tyler Raclin, Erik Kerrigan, (’21) Jeremy Yuan, Justin Lee, Alejandro Rodriguez, (‘17) Pete Muncey, Max Hawkins, Sven Kranz, Brian Sun, (’16) Bobby Adusumilli, William Leddy, Gordon Zhang, (’22) Joshua Xu, Alex Guzhva, Malachi Coleman, Shramay Dhawan, Arthur Chau, Esteban Silva]]></content>

      <title><![CDATA[MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference 2019]]></title>
      <url>/sports/2019/03/21/SSAC/</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[This post is coming a bit late, but I have finally finishedWinter quarter at UChicago and am excited to share some ofmy experiences from the MIT Sloan Sports AnalyticsConference!#SSAC19For those of you that don’t know, the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference is aconference held every year in Boston where industry leaders in basketball,football, baseball, etc., researchers, startups, and analytics enthusiastsgather to discuss and learn about all things related to sports analytics. Thisyear it was held at the Hynes Convention Center from March 1-2 and I wasfortunate enough to attend both the conference and the hackathon that tookplace the day before. The conference was especially exciting for me because inthe fall I worked on action recognition with the purpose of applying it tobasketball footage and this would be an amazing place to learn more about thecutting edge in computer vision application for sports.The theme for this year’s hackathon was designing a unique digital fanexperience; we were given hawk eye data and match data from the 2018 BNPParibas Open, specifically from the women’s matches, to complete the challenge.Hawk eye data included the exact locations of the tennis ball during the serveas well as information about point duration and how the point was won. Weactually made it to the finals of the competition which was super exciting, andwere given the opportunity to present our idea during the second day of theconference. I’m not going to go super in depth into the idea and the models,but you can find our final presentationhere, a rough demohere(my first time using sketch and it was an amazing learning experience),and the final presentationshere(we start about 50 minutes in).During the conference I had the opportunity to hear a ton of amazing peopletalk about sports as well as meet a bunch of people from startups doing reallycool work with computer vision and AR/VR (pose estimation, action recognition,VR training, etc.). Some of my personal favorites were:  Bob Myers, Zach Lowe, Mike Zarren, and Paul Pierce talking about “unicorns”in basketball. It was a super fun discussion and one of my biggest takeaways wasthat Shaq would still be an unreal player in the NBA today.  Meek Mill and Michael Rubin discussing social justice reform. A trulyinspiring talk and extremely eye opening to hear about the side of America thatso many of us have the privilege of not seeing on a day to day basis.  Adam Silver answering a bunch of questions pertaining to the current state ofthe NBA and its players. The most surprising thing that Adam Silver discussedwas the disconnect between how fans perceive the professional basketballlifestyle and the reality of players and their mental health.  Katie Nolan, Larry Fitzgerald, Adam Hansmann, and Jeanie Buss discussing therelationship between athletes and the media and how that has evolved over theyears. It was very interesting to hear so many perspectives on this topic fromplayers and owners to people who create media content.  Malcolm Gladwell and David Epstein discussing the modern athlete and what ittakes to become a world class athlete. This was the most relevant talk for me interms of tennis and improving myself as a tennis player; most of the talkrevolved around the theme of why it is important to acquire a diverse set ofskills and try new things rather than hyper specialize in one area from anextremely young age.Overall, I had an amazing time at the conference and I look forward to havingan opportunity to attend again!Please do not hesitate to reach out and provide commentary or feedback on thispost!]]></content>

      <title><![CDATA[Warby Parker AR]]></title>
      <url>/ar/vr/2019/02/10/warby-parker-ar/</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Warby Parker introduces virtual try-on using ARKit. The results are realisticand I am excited by the impact AR will have on the fashion/clothing industry.AR may even have the potential to change the way people express their style inthe future!OverviewWarby Parker’s new virtual try-on feature delivers an AR experience real enoughthat current and future customers might actually skip the store and the hometry-on before making a purchase. Trying on glasses virtually/online is notsomething new; many companies and websites have been doing this for quite awhile, either by uploading a picture of your face or through the webcam. Theoverall experience of these methods was poor and it never felt like you weregetting a realistic view of how the glasses looked. Warby Parker has always beenknown to be extremely thoughtful about the customer and they definitely workedhard to create an experience that was as valuable to the customer as possible.For the rest of this post we will deviate slightly away from Warby Parker totalk about the impact of AR in the fashion/clothing industry; specifically,how AR will change online shopping and the possibility of collaborativeshopping. Given the collaborative nature of AR, we end with a discussion onhow AR can change the way we present ourselves to others.AR and Online ShoppingThe two biggest issues that I face when online shopping are: 1) not knowing ifthe item will look good and 2) not knowing which size to choose.Warby Parker uses home try-on as a solution to this problem, customers canchoose up to 5 frames to try on at home for free and then send back. However,I think this program still creates some friction between looking at the glassesonline and actually purchasing a pair. It takes around 5 days for the hometry-on frames to arrive and another 5 days for the purchased frames to arrive,I imagine this whole process will take around 2 weeks as well as a trip to themailbox to ship the frames back (which can be a hassle). Virtual try-on improvesthe confidence consumers have when purchasing frames without trying the realframes. I believe an ideal shopping experience should involve only one shipmentwhere every item looks/fits as great as the customer expected. AR will makethis a reality.AR, computer vision, and sensors will improve to a point in the near futurewhere they can accurately create 3D models of the human body and overlay virtualclothing over the model that moves and reacts just like real fabric. This willtransform the online shopping experience; every item can be rendered perfectlyover any body giving the consumer confidence that whichever item they choosewill look/fit great. Even items in your own wardrobe can be virtually tried onbefore deciding on an outfit. A ton of companies are already starting to developtechnology to make this possible, Uniqlo, Gap, Amazon, etc.Ultimately, this can lead to collaborative AR shopping where friends can viewthe item and give you feedback while you try it on. Physical fitting rooms havemany limitations that collaborative virtual fitting rooms can solve: 1) it ishard to get feedback from friends on clothing, 2) during busy hours there is aline for the fitting room, 3) you have to bring multiple sizes of the same itemwith you or go back out to find the correct size. I think there is a ton ofpotential for collaborative AR fitting rooms, friends across the world can goshopping with each other, stylists can give advice to clients remotely, etc. Itis extremely exciting to think about how AR can connect people in meaningfulways.Final ThoughtsI think that AR has the ability to fundamentally change how we expressourselves. Given an environment where many users are using head mounted AR,there is no limitation to how we dress ourselves virtually and present ourselvesto others. Rather than constantly purchasing new clothes, which can be quiteexpensive, or being limited by the selection at shops, consumers can virtuallydress themselves in whatever they want. Imagine walking down the street in at-shirt and sweats but everyone else sees you walking in a full suit of armor.Imagine going into a business meeting in jeans but everyone else sees you in asuit. Anyone can dress however they want at almost no cost.Please do not hesitate to reach out and provide commentary or feedback on thispost!]]></content>

      <title><![CDATA[IKEA Place]]></title>
      <url>/ar/vr/2019/01/31/ikea-place/</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[IKEA Place is one of the few mobile AR apps that uses AR to address a realcustomer pain point and is actually really fun to use.IntroductionRecently I have found myself spending a lot of time playing around with IKEAPlace. The premise of the app is extremely simple: visualize how various IKEAproducts would look in your home. No more manual measurements and mentalvisualizations; this app speeds up the process of purchasing furniture byensuring that new pieces fit in your home and look good. But IKEA Place is notjust another mobile AR app, IKEA Place is a product that adds value to thecustomer experience by solving a key pain point in the purchasing process and itjust so happens that the best way to deliver that value is through mobile AR.The reason I find IKEA Place to be so enjoyable and such a compelling mobileAR product is because:  The app communicates to me in a familiar way that feels very personal  The UI is extremely intuitive, and the AR graphics are some of the bestthat I have seen on mobile  The app is functionalCommunicationThe app communicates to me in a familiar way that feels very personal anddemonstrates to me that the development and management team had a clear customersegment that they were targeting. Traditionally, a large segment of IKEA’scustomers consisted of young working professionals. These customers boughtfurniture outside of working hours (IKEA closes at 9PM) and looked for goodlooking, affordable, easy to assemble furniture. IKEA Place continues to focusattention on this segment, and it shows through their design choices.After installing the app, the user is immediately presented a messenger-likescreen where the app walks through its different capabilities and prompts theuser to interact with it and send responses back. It then explains why it needsaccess to the camera before asking for permission, a simple gesture that reallystands out. This introduction sequence sets up the foundation for how the appcommunicates with the user.I spend a lot of time each day on iMessage and Messenger, so it was immediatelyfamiliar when the app communicated to me in a similar way. While using the app,information is communicated through chat bubbles that appear at the top givingprompts to try certain features or just simply to welcome me back after openingthe app. The overall experience feels very personal, like having an assistantsending me messages through the app, but not robotic. The app’s messages feelvery casual and conversational, even adding in emojis.Although unrelated to the product, I also find their promotional videos to beincredibly interesting. One of their videos shows young adults struggling withfurniture and the other is a fun video where AR gamers try out the app. The feelof the videos is very modern and is clearly targeted towards young adults.You can find the videoshere andhere.Through a clear understanding of their initial target customer segment, IKEAPlace makes design choices that lead to an enjoyable and memorable userexperience.UI and GraphicsTo begin, the UI is extremely intuitive. On the home screen there are threebuttons: search for similar products, find products to place in your room, viewfavorited products. The presentation is simple and the icons on the buttons areinformative of their purpose. While using the app and trying out the differentfeatures I never felt lost or confused. The steps required to perform an actionwere clear to me and allowed me to solely focus on picking out differentproducts and placing them in the space around me.Furthermore, the quality of the AR graphics in IKEA Place look really good.Objects that you place in your room really feel like they are sitting on theground and have realistic shadows. Additionally, the objects scale correctly asyou move around it and remain in place when out of frame. These are small thingsthat we may take for granted in mobile AR but when done well it really standsout. IKEA Place is built on ARKit for iOS and ARCore for Android, I am excitedto see new applications for mobile AR emerge as both these platforms continue toimprove.Mobile AR is often underwhelming for users that are looking for truly immersiveexperiences, but nonetheless mobile AR still has a place in the AR field, bothas a stepping stone and as a type of use case. IKEA Place is a perfect exampleof how by combining simple design with great graphics, mobile AR can alsodeliver a realistic and immersive experience.FunctionalAt the end of the day, IKEA Place creates a functional solution to the problemsthat consumers face when purchasing furniture. The purpose of AR is clear andenhances the customer experience. The interface and design work together todeliver value to the user and do not take away from the functionality of theapp.Mobile AR is often a gimmick, not adding any real value and actually taking awayfrom the functionality of the product. Even in well designed products it can betough to integrate AR in a meaningful way. For example, Pokémon Go integrates ARinto the Pokémon catching experience but most players opt out of using AR modeand most of the game takes place outside of an AR experience. To be fair, Ithink AR does add value to Pokémon Go and they have been improving their ARexperience with AR Plus but it is still interesting to think about how to bestintegrate AR into your product and if AR adds value to the user experience.IKEA Place set themselves up for success by choosing a problem that is bestsolved through AR and then delivers an amazing mobile AR experience thatprovides the essential functionality to actually solve that problem.Final ThoughtsIKEA Place is a very good mobile AR product that I thoroughly enjoyed using;however, it is not without its flaws. The app could have integrated mobilepurchasing for furniture that a customer has tried out and favorited to completethe full pipeline from downloading the app to making a purchase. Currently acustomer would have to try out different products in the app and then click onthe name of each product individually (while in AR mode) to be redirected to theIKEA website before making the purchase. It would be cool to see a morenoticeable and friendlier interface for making mobile purchases along withApple/Google Pay integration. Overall, IKEA Place is a great product and I lookforward seeing what the IKEA digital transformation team comes up with next!Please do not hesitate to reach out and provide commentary or feedback on thispost!]]></content>
