I have not posted on my blog in a while so here is a quick update on what I have
been up to lately:

- Played my last college tennis match in the Final Four of the NCAA tournament
- Graduated from the University of Chicago with a B.S. in Computer Science
- Updated the look of my website (as you can see)
- Traveled around Iceland in a camper van

I will begin to post more regularly on my blog so keep your eyes out for new
content!
