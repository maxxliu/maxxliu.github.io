Warby Parker introduces virtual try-on using ARKit. The results are realistic
and I am excited by the impact AR will have on the fashion/clothing industry.
AR may even have the potential to change the way people express their style in
the future!

# Overview

Warby Parkerâ€™s new virtual try-on feature delivers an AR experience real enough
that current and future customers might actually skip the store and the home
try-on before making a purchase. Trying on glasses virtually/online is not
something new; many companies and websites have been doing this for quite a
while, either by uploading a picture of your face or through the webcam. The
overall experience of these methods was poor and it never felt like you were
getting a realistic view of how the glasses looked. Warby Parker has always been
known to be extremely thoughtful about the customer and they definitely worked
hard to create an experience that was as valuable to the customer as possible.

For the rest of this post we will deviate slightly away from Warby Parker to
talk about the impact of AR in the fashion/clothing industry; specifically,
how AR will change online shopping and the possibility of collaborative
shopping. Given the collaborative nature of AR, we end with a discussion on
how AR can change the way we present ourselves to others.

# AR and Online Shopping

The two biggest issues that I face when online shopping are: 1) not knowing if
the item will look good and 2) not knowing which size to choose.

Warby Parker uses home try-on as a solution to this problem, customers can
choose up to 5 frames to try on at home for free and then send back. However,
I think this program still creates some friction between looking at the glasses
online and actually purchasing a pair. It takes around 5 days for the home
try-on frames to arrive and another 5 days for the purchased frames to arrive,
I imagine this whole process will take around 2 weeks as well as a trip to the
mailbox to ship the frames back (which can be a hassle). Virtual try-on improves
the confidence consumers have when purchasing frames without trying the real
frames. I believe an ideal shopping experience should involve only one shipment
where every item looks/fits as great as the customer expected. AR will make
this a reality.

AR, computer vision, and sensors will improve to a point in the near future
where they can accurately create 3D models of the human body and overlay virtual
clothing over the model that moves and reacts just like real fabric. This will
transform the online shopping experience; every item can be rendered perfectly
over any body giving the consumer confidence that whichever item they choose
will look/fit great. Even items in your own wardrobe can be virtually tried on
before deciding on an outfit. A ton of companies are already starting to develop
technology to make this possible, Uniqlo, Gap, Amazon, etc.

Ultimately, this can lead to collaborative AR shopping where friends can view
the item and give you feedback while you try it on. Physical fitting rooms have
many limitations that collaborative virtual fitting rooms can solve: 1) it is
hard to get feedback from friends on clothing, 2) during busy hours there is a
line for the fitting room, 3) you have to bring multiple sizes of the same item
with you or go back out to find the correct size. I think there is a ton of
potential for collaborative AR fitting rooms, friends across the world can go
shopping with each other, stylists can give advice to clients remotely, etc. It
is extremely exciting to think about how AR can connect people in meaningful
ways.

# Final Thoughts

I think that AR has the ability to fundamentally change how we express
ourselves. Given an environment where many users are using head mounted AR,
there is no limitation to how we dress ourselves virtually and present ourselves
to others. Rather than constantly purchasing new clothes, which can be quite
expensive, or being limited by the selection at shops, consumers can virtually
dress themselves in whatever they want. Imagine walking down the street in a
t-shirt and sweats but everyone else sees you walking in a full suit of armor.
Imagine going into a business meeting in jeans but everyone else sees you in a
suit. Anyone can dress however they want at almost no cost.
